        The way I see it, life is a pile of good things and bad things. The good
        things don’t always soften the bad things , but vice versa, the bad
        things don’t always spoil the good things and make them unimportant. <br>

        Less planting your own seeds in the minds of others knowing they won’t
        water them. More watering your own seeds, allowing your minds’ garden to
        inspire others to grow their own. Work on you, for you<br>

        Life is so ironic. It takes sadness to know what happiness is, noise to
        appreciate silence, and absence to value presence.<br>

        Just when you think you’ve successfully navigated one obstacle,
        another emerges. But that’s what keeps life interesting. Life is a
        process of breaking through these impediments — a series of fortified
        lines that we must break through. Each time, you’ll learn something.
        Each time, you’ll develop strength, wisdom, and perspective. Each time,
        a little more of the competition falls away. Until all that is left is
        you: the best version of you. .<br>
